# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.

# NOTES:

# - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names

# for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.

# - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using

# jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).

```python

class Neg(ScalarFunction):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        return -x

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, d):
        f_prime = -1
        return f_prime * d
```
